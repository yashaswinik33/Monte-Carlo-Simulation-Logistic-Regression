## 📚 Abstract

Case-control studies are a widely used observational design for investigating associations between exposures and outcomes. Logistic regression is commonly applied to model binary outcomes while adjusting for covariates, confounders, and effect modifiers. However, when exposure distributions are skewed i.e., unevenly distributed between cases and controls—statistical inference can be compromised.

This study uses a series of **Monte Carlo simulations** to examine the impact of skewed exposure distributions on the performance of logistic regression. Specifically, it evaluates:
- 🔍 **Power of the Wald test**
- 📉 **Bias in regression coefficients**
- ⚖️ **Effect of including continuous covariates**

The simulations emphasize how covariates contribute to more reliable effect estimation in the presence of skewness. The findings underscore the importance of having prior knowledge about exposure and covariate characteristics when determining sample size and study design. Simulations conducted across varying sample sizes and numbers of covariates demonstrated improved robustness and reduction in bias under skewed conditions.
